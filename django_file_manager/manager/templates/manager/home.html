  <h3>What's this about?</h3>
  <p>
    This Django application is an web application I created to help file publishers and subscribers manage uploading and viewing documents</a>.
    In this application, users can sign up as a subscriber or a publisher. Publishers can upload files and subscribers can view files based on their interests.
